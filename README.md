# Useful scripts for Rotation Measure synthesis technique 

These scripts come from my master degree thesis project. They are not optimized, and can be redundant in their operations, *but* they (apparently) work.

- RMsynth_cubes_maker.py is a script that allows to create Stokes *Q* and *U* cubes for RM synthesis using the outputs of WSClean.
